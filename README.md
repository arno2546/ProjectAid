# ProjectAid
The intent of Project-aid is to comprise a platform where people can share their ideas with individuals that has the capacity to make their ideas into reality. As many great ideas get nipped in the bud due to lack of funding, mentorship or experience, which otherwise could be realized with sufficient support from the right people. Hence the need for this platform to connect those in need of aid with those who can provide it.
This whole project is derived around three types of users. General users are the ones seeking aid and sponsors are the ones providing it & admin is the authoritative figure in the whole system with the ability to ban or verify anyone or any project.
